At this point in a CTF, my assumption would be that I’d need to chain exploits on the web servers to gain access via SSH.</p><p>As it turns out, that assumption was incorrect. Nevertheless, my methodology in this situation remains the same. I use my browser to navigate to the default web server, located on port 80, and am greeted with the following Joker image:</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Port_80_Home.png" alt="Port 80 Web Server Home Page" /></p><p>It’s not much, and scrolling down only gives a gallery of posters with quotes from Batman movies. I check the source code, but I find nothing of importance to the completion of the CTF.</p><p>At this point I want to check out the other web server. But as I’ve said before, time management is important, so I run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dirsearch -u 10.10.239.128 -E -w /opt/wordlists/dir-and-file-names.txt -t 15 --plain-text-report scans/dirsearch_80.txt</code> to bruteforce through potential directories on this web server while I check out the web server on port 8080. I navigate to the site using my browser and am greeted with the following screen:</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Port_8080_Login.png" alt="HTTP Basic Auth Login Screen on Port 8080" /></p><p>It’s an HTTP Basic Authentication login prompt, which, unless I want to try some funny business, means I’m going to need to proccur a username and password to access the rest of the web server. This being a Joker/Batman themed box, I have my suspicions about what the username may be. But, since my dirsearch scan is wrapping up, I decide to wait and see if it returns any useful directories.</p><p>My dirsearch scan wraps up with the following output: <br /></p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;--Snipped!--&gt;

</code></pre></div></div><p>After navigating to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/secret.txt</code> path, I find the following snippet of what seems to be an altercation between Batman and Joker.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Secret_txt.png" alt="Conversation Between Batman and Joker" /></p><p>Well, that doesn’t exactly provide any additional information. With that said, since I was was already assuming that the login credentials would be Batman/Joker related, I choose to go ahead with an HTTP Basic Authentication bruteforce using the username <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">joker</code>. Here is the command I used: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hydra -l joker -P /opt/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.239.128 http-get -s 8080 -v</code>, and the resulting output:</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Hydra.png" alt="Hydra Command and Output" /></p><p>I authenticate using those credentials and am greeted by a basic Joomla blog.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Port_8080_Home.png" alt="Joomla Blog" /></p><p>Splitting a CTF into Enumeration, User, and Root, is useful as an organizational tool. With that said, CTFs, or even real-world scenarios like penetration tests and red team engagements, cannot be adequately divided in such a way. And that is particularly the case because of the enumeration section. Simply put, we are constantly enumerating. With every new asset that is discovered, new foothold obtained, or new privilege gained, we enumerate again. Security engagements are a cyclical process of re-enumeration.</p><p>So although the enumeration truly never ends, I think this is a good point to segue into the next section. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user</code> shell is near. <br /> <br /></p><h1 id="user">User</h1><p>My first instinct when greeted with the login form is to try the same credentials which I used to pass through the HTTP Basic Authentication. I try that combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">joker:&lt;--Censored!--&gt;</code> but no dice, the creds don’t work.</p><p>I decide to launch another directory bruteforce, but on this webserver instead. Here is the command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gobuster -u 10.10.239.128:8080 -w opt/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x .txt,.zip,.html,.php -t 15 -o scans/gobuster_8080.txt -U joker -P &lt;--Censored!--&gt;</code>. I chose not to use dirsearch this time because it doesn’t support HTTP Basic Authentication, I’ll probably fork it and add that functionality in the future.</p><p>The interesting things found by the scan are an administrator login portal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/administrator</code> but also what seems to be a backup file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/backup.zip</code>. I quickly try the credentials again in the administrator login, but as expected that does not work, then I navigate to the backup file and it triggers a download.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Backup.png" alt="Download From /Backup.zip" /></p><p>I save the file and attempt to unzip it using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzip</code> command, but I receive a prompt asking me for a password. As should be your first instinct in this situation, I check for password reuse and ta-dah! It accepts the password <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;--Censored!--&gt;</code> and I am able to unzip the file and view its contents.</p><p>But what could I have done had the Joker not reused their password? In CTF situations where I want to unlock a .zip file without knowing the password, one of the first things I try is a combination of Zip2John and JohnTheRipper. For those unaware, JohnTheRipper is far more than Hashcat’s slower little brother. It in fact comes with a suite of programs which are built to extract hashes from various file types, to then be cracked by the John password cracking tool.</p><p>So after using this command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip2john loot/backup.zip &gt; loot/zip_hash.txt</code> to extract a hash from the backup.zip file, I then use John to crack that hash and find the password.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/John_Zip_Hash.png" alt="Using John to Crack a Hash" /></p><p>After unzipping the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backup.zip</code> file we are provided two directories:</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Loot.png" alt="My Loot Directory: Contains backup.zip, db, site, zip_hash.txt" /></p><p>In this case the information we need is located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db</code> directory. If you didn’t know, most modern websites utilize databases to store a lot of data about the site, including hashed passwords. I decide to use this command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep db/ -r admin</code> to dig out all the lines with the word “admin” in every file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db</code> directory. As we can see from the following image, the admin’s password hash has been found.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Grep_For_Admin.png" alt="Grep of db Directory" /></p><p>I toss John at that hash and it cracks within a few seconds:</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/John_Admin_Hash.png" alt="Using John to Crack the Joomla Hash" /></p><p>Looks like our username and password combination is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin:&lt;--Censored!--&gt;</code>. I test that login information at the admin portal and successfully authenticate into the administrator control panel.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Joomla_Admin_Panel.png" alt="Joomla Administrator Control Panel" /></p><p>With the ability to edit pages and plugins on a website, one can usually gain remote code execution. I navigate to the templates page, then edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error.php</code> page with a Linux PHP reverse shell. When I navigate to a page that does not exist, the website will load the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error.php</code> page and launch a reverse shell to my Netcat listener. I would paste the Linux PHP Reverse Shell here but it’s really rather large so instead you click <a href="https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php">here</a> to be taken to a github where it is hosted.</p><p>I set up a Netcat listener then attempt to navigate to a page that does not exist, to trigger the reverse shell. As you can see from the following screenshot, I try to go the page <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.php/henwo</code>.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Henwo.png" alt="Navigating to /index.php/henwo" /></p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/User_Shell.png" alt="Catching the Reverse Shell With Netcat" /></p><p>And ta-dah! The reverse shell is caught by my Netcat listener and we have a user shell as www-data. In the next section I will demonstrate how to upgrade this reverse shell to allow for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backspace</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+c</code> functionality and then escalate my privileges to root. If you are observant, you can actually glean, from this screenshot alone, a key piece of information that hints at how to gain root privileges. <br /> <br /></p><h1 id="root">Root</h1><p>To upgrade our reverse shell to have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backspace</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+c</code> functionality, I first try to find out if a version of Python is available to this user. I use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which</code> against both “python” and “python3” to find that Python3 is available. I then use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"</code> which is a Python3 one-liner to import the pty module, then spawn a Python3 based pty session using the binary located at /bin/bash. This should allow us to backspace and use arrow keys to move our cursor around.</p><p>After this I do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export TERM=xterm</code> to allow us to clear the screen. The final command to upgrade this shell is the easiest to mess up, as such, please use the following .gif for clarification.</p><p>I use the key combination <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+z</code> to background the Netcat process, returning me to my local terminal. Then, I type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stty raw -echo</code> and hit enter. Now, I type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg</code> and hit enter. <em>Notice that the text</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg</code> <em>does not show up, this is because of the previous command which affects how our keyboard input is received by the hardware.</em> I then type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reset</code>, hit enter, and we have a fully functioning shell on the victim machine which does not stop when we hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+c</code>.</p><p><img src="/assets/media/joker/Full_Shell_Demo.gif" alt="Gif Showcasing the Shell Upgrade" /></p><p>Now, onto privilege escalation!</p><p>Usually, this moment in a CTF would have me enumerating by using automated tools such as linPEAS and looking around the box to find anything out of the ordinary. However, as you may have seen from when we got the intial shell, we know that our user <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www-data</code> is part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lxd</code> group. The lxd group is a group that typically allows a user to use LXD, which is a Linux container manager. By the nature of containers, they are usually required to be run by a highly privileged daemon. Since we are part of the lxd group, I suspect that we will be able to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lxc</code> to interface with the LXD daemon and escalate our privileges.</p><p>Since we’re dealing with containers, we’re likely to need a container image. You can find a compileable version of Alpine for Linux at <a href="https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder">this</a> Github page. Just clone the Github page and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./build-alpine</code> and it will generate an Alpine image for you.</p><p>I start by switching to the directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/shm</code>. This is a directory that is highly likely to be writeable by even low privileged users. Then, I launch local HTTP server and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> to download my Alpine image. My HTTP server of choice is called Updog. It can be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip3 install updog</code>. <br /></p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>www-data@ubuntu:/$ cd /dev/shm
